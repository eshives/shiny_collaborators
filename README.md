# shiny_collaborators
Shiny App created for BIOS 611 (Intro to Data Science) project 3 at University of North Carolina

# Who does the University of North Carolina collaborate with for research? About what topics?

Project 3 guidelines:

Use the Pubmed abstracts dataset

Organize your project as a Nextflow pipeline

At least one step of the pipeline must be run in a Docker container. This pipeline should terminate with data that is in a CSV format.

Publish your results as a Shiny dashboard. The dashboard will utilize the CSV data produced by your pipeline.

The dashboard should display the top ten collaborating institutions (based on number of abstracts shared with UNC), and allow the user to view the most abundant, differentiating words in the abstracts associated with each collaborating institution. In other words, answer the questions 1) who does UNC collaborate with and 2) what are the likely subject emphases of those collaborations?

Submit your project on Github
